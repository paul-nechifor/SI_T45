# DNSSEC Toy

A DNSSEC server and resolver implementation.

This project includes:

    * an authoritative server;
    * an iterative resolver;
    * a keypair generator tool;
    * a zone signing tool;
    * and an example tree for testing.

This was one of my homeworks for the [Information Security][1] course.
